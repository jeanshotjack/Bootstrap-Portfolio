# Bootstrap-Portfolio
# This is a very simple portfolio page for all my upcoming projects that I built using Bootstrap! It contains:
<ul> 
  <li>an "About Me" page so you can learn who I am and where I'm at in life</li>
  <li>a "Portfolio" page that is currently just placeholder cards but will eventually contain my actual projects
  edit: now contains hellspawn "Psychic Game"</li>
  <li>a "Contact" page where you can write to me! but it doesn't really work yet</li>
</ul>
